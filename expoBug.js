While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the Metro bundler would randomly crash during development, without providing any specific error messages in the terminal.  This would halt the development process, requiring a restart of the Expo CLI server.  The crashes were inconsistent, occurring at seemingly random points in the application's execution. This behavior was observed across multiple projects and platforms.
